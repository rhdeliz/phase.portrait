\title{Run Self-Test for Phase Portrait Analysis Package}
\usage{
self_test()
}
\value{
No return value. Saves analysis results and plots to the working directory.
}
\description{
This function performs a self-test of the phase portrait analysis workflow. It simulates example data, processes it, and runs a comprehensive analysis with specified parameters, saving the resulting plots and data summaries.
}
\details{
The function uses the Lotka-Volterra model to generate an example dataset, normalizes and computes derivatives on the data, and then performs a complete analysis pipeline including phase portrait and trajectory plotting. The outputs are saved automatically as files for verification.
}
\examples{
# Run the self-test to verify package functionality:
self_test()
}
