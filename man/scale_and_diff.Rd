\title{Normalize Values and Calculate Derivatives}
\usage{
scale_and_diff(df, save = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with a \code{value} column to be normalized and a \code{variable} column for grouping.}

\item{save}{Logical, if TRUE, saves the output as a compressed CSV file named "delta_lead.csv.gz". Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with normalized \code{value} and calculated \code{delta} columns.
}
\description{
This function normalizes the \code{value} column within each group in a data frame and calculates the derivative (difference) between consecutive values. It first shifts values within each group to compute differences, then performs min-max normalization for consistency across groups. Optionally, results can be saved as a compressed CSV file.
}
\examples{
# Create an example data frame for normalization and differentiation
df <- data.frame(
  value = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  variable = "var1",
  pseudotime = 1:5
)

# Apply normalization and differentiation
normalized_df <- scale_and_diff(df)

# Apply and save the output
normalized_df <- scale_and_diff(df, save = TRUE)
}
